# Hybrid-ML-Pneumonia-Detection
This project uses a Hybrid Machine Learning approach to detect Pneumonia by combining deep learning on chest X-ray images and a Random Forest classifier on patient symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Final predictions are made by fusing outputs from both models to improve accuracy. Dataset Link (Chest X-ray Images): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
